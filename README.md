Secure Pictures is a powerful solution for protecting your photos, sounds and videos taken by your BlackBerry® 10 device camera and dictaphone. It is suitable for individual users as well as corporations in demand of securing private pictures and videos, dictated ideas, whiteboard screenshots, internal meeting videotapes, document scans and photo copies. You can also protect them after you've already captured them.

Secure Pictures protects your pictures, sounds and videos in two efficient ways: 
* It encrypts them using your secure password. 
* It is the only application capable of opening those encrypted camera shots and voice records. 

The AES-256 symmetric cryptography is used to protect your camera shots and your secure password is used as a secure key. The application is using a built-in BlackBerry Library for the Security Builder Government Security Edition SB GSE-C that is also known as BlackBerry OS Cryptographic Kernel.

Your key is kept secret and is safely stored on your device. 

Do not share your password with others otherwise your pictures and videos will not be safe.
